# What Makes an Appealing Influencer?

## Brief Description:

In this Data Blog project from Spring 2023, I focused on the relationship between the use of certain hashtags and level of engagement for TikTok videos, utilizing engagement metrics as measurements of a TikToker's appeal. With Apifyâ€™s TikTok scraper, I collected data by web scraping 1,000 TikTok videos per hashtag search for each of the 50 most popular TikTok hashtags from 2022 listed by CapCut. Using the ggplot2 package in R, I created a stacked bar chart showing the average level of engagement for each engagement type (i.e. comments, likes, plays, and shares) across the list of 50 hashtags.

My explanation of multiple trends derived from this stacked bar chart can be found in a section of an article published on Medium (https://ucladatares.medium.com/what-makes-an-appealing-influencer-8951802cae68).
